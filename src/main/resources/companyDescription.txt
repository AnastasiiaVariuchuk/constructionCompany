The company's activity is based on the combination of many unique technologies for the construction of absolutely any, in terms of complexity, even the most unusual in terms of solution, buildings and structures. The concept is based on the idea to simplify as much as possible the solution of tasks related to the construction of facilities for completely different areas of business, as well as a private client. The use in construction of both traditional technologies and materials, as well as modern ones, allow us to erect buildings in a short time with “minimal costs”. The company includes a group of enterprises for the provision of construction services and the production of building structures, united in one chain. We have a full cycle from production to construction and commissioning of the facility. The construction process includes: development of the concept of the building (3-D visualization), designing all stages of the project, drawing up a clear estimated cost and construction schedules, as well as a complete set of objects with materials, equipment and even, if necessary, furniture.
